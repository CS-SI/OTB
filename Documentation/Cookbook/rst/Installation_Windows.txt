Windows binary packages are available for Windows 7 or higher. They can
be downloaded from `otb download page <https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/download>`_ .

Pick the correct version (32 bit or 64 bit) depending on your system.

Extract the archive and use one of the launchers, they contain all applications
and their launchers (both command line and graphical launchers are provided):

-  ``monteverdi.bat`` : A launcher script for Monteverdi

-  ``mapla.bat`` : A launcher script for Mapla

-  ``otbenv.bat`` : A script to initialize the environment for OTB
   executables

-  ``bin`` : A folder containing application launchers (otbcli.bat,
   otbgui.bat) and the DLLs.

-  ``lib`` : A folder containing application DLLs.

The applications can be launched from the Mapla launcher. If you want to
use the otbcli and otbgui launchers, you can initialize a command prompt
with ``otbenv.bat``.

Python bindings
---------------
Starting from OTB 5.8.0, OTB python bindings are distributed with binary package.
currently only Python 2.x is supported. If no compatible python is found, installation
notify you about it. If everything works fine, you will be given information about
using python bindings.

You must have python numpy bindings installed in your system. you can install it locally
without admin rights with "pip install --user numpy". This is to give users to choose
their own existing python installation rather than distributing one in OTB package

Notes:
~~~~~~
- You must have "Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015" installed for using this package.
  It can be downloaded freely from `microsoft <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145>`_
