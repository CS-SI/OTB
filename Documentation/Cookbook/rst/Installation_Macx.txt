We provide for MacOS X through a standalone package. This package is a
self-extractible archive, quite similar to the Linux one. You may
uncompress it with the command line :

.. parsed-literal::

    chmod +x OTB-|release|-Darwin64.run
    ./OTB-|release|-Darwin64.run

Once the archive is extracted, you can see OTB-|release|-Darwin64 directory in
the same direcrtory along with OTB-|release|-Darwin64.run

Contents of OTB-|release|-Darwin64 is briefly listed below:

-  ``Monteverdi.app`` : A Mac OSX .app for Monteverdi

-  ``Mapla.app`` : A Mac OSX .app for Mapla.

-  ``bin`` : A folder containing application launchers (otbcli.sh,
   otbgui.sh), monteverdi and mapla binaries.

-  ``lib`` : A folder containing all shared libraries and OTB
   applications.

-  ``share`` : A folder containing common resources and copyright
   mentions.

Python bindings
---------------
Starting from OTB 5.8.0, OTB python bindings are distributed with binary package.
currently only Python 2.x is supported. If no compatible python is found, installation
notify you about it. If everything works fine, you will be given information about
using python bindings.

You must have python numpy bindings installed in your system. you can install it locally
without admin rights with "pip install --user numpy". This is to give users to choose
their own existing python installation rather than distributing one in OTB package

Notes:

-  If you want to use the otbcli and otbgui launchers, you must access
   them via a terminal prompt.

-  The OSX .app are provided for monteverdi (viewer) and mapla
   (application browser).

-  You must use monteverdi and mapla through their .app files only.

-  You are allowed to move these .app files and refrain from moving or
   deleting OTB-|release|-Darwin64 after extraction. In case you need to have OTB
   installed in some other directory. Extract the .run file there.
